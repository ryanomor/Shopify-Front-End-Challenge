    "Create a form:\n- If the email input does not validate, an error message should be rendered below the field.\n- If the email input is valid, the form should submit without reloading or navigating away from the page.\n- The value of each field should be logged in the browser console.\n- It should show a loading state for 2 seconds, to simulate an HTTP request.\n- It should allow only a single submission. Subsequent attempts to submit should be ignored after the initial submission.\n- After the simulated request, a \"thank you\" message should replace the form without refreshing the page."
